* Motivation *

The cleverly named 'Scheme site template' is a scheme library which
provides a small template for building websites. 

Scheme is naturally good at tree manipulation, (HTML is a tree), has
built in support for quoted and quasi-quoted lists/trees, which means
built in support for templating of trees. Better yet, it's functional,
which means higher order templating. 

So, why not use it to generate your HTML? Instead of opening and closing
HTML tags, you open parens and type the SXML (S-Expression XML) tag. Of
course, you're using a real text editor so it closed the parens for you.
You can perform manipulations over your HTML, generate lists, create
functions to generate long HTML blocks. It's just a much better
environment for writing your website.

* Installation * 

Just run:
> make install
or
> INSTALLDIR=~/lib/scheme make install

Then simply ensure wjb/scheme-site-template.sls is in your library path.
You can do this by placing is in e.g. ~/lib, and using the --libdirs command
line flag:

> cp -r wjb/ ~/lib/
> scheme --libdirs ~/lib/

You can also add it via the environment variable CHEZSCHEMELIBDIRS:

> export CHEZSCHEMELIBDIRS=.:~/lib/

* How to use *

High level overview: 

Well, import the library. It has a massive list of exported parameters.
Each is a function, which when called, returns a piece of the SXML tree.
It's designed to be quite modular, so hopefully the default will work a
lot of the time, and if not, you can set new values. 

If you don't like the default, you can set up your own defaults to be
used in almost all your webpages. After setting up the default, just
import the file where the default are defined, and then override
whatever elements change (generally, the body and the title). Then you
run the compile function on the SXML tree.

For the details, see the example files/projects.
